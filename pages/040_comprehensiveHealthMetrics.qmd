# Comprehensive Health Metrics

This section provides a detailed overview of various health indicators within our community. We cover a wide range of topics, including medical conditions, risk factors, and other critical health data. By examining these metrics, we can better understand the overall health status of our population and identify areas needing improvement. The data presented here will help inform public health strategies and interventions. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the well-being of all community members through informed decision-making and targeted health initiatives.

### Health Status

The CDC Places project helps us evaluate our community health status with three measures: fair or poor self-rated health, frequent physical distress, and frequent mental distress among individuals aged 18 and older. The next three plots and tables indicate that Polk County and Norman County have health statuses statistically similar to the state of Minnesota, based on the age-adjusted confidence interval. However, Mahnomen County shows a higher prevalence in all three measures compared to the other two counties and the state of Minnesota. This suggests that Mahnomen County may require more targeted health interventions to address these higher levels of health distress.

### Mental Health

As you will see, our three counties and the state of Minnesota show that roughly 1 in every 3 to 4 people is projected to experience depression. This high ratio is also reflected in the Minnesota Student Survey responses from our 9th graders. When asked how often they have felt down, depressed, or hopeless over the past two weeks, about 1 in every 3 to 5 reported feeling this way. Mahnomen County had the highest percentage of 9th graders responding 'yes' to this question.

Unfortunately, Norman County did not participate in the Minnesota Student Survey in 2022, but we are hopeful they will next year. We are ready to provide support in any way possible, as the Minnesota Student Survey offers valuable insights. It helps us understand the potential hardships students are facing, such as depression.

A very encouraging sign is Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen counties appear to be doing well in screening for mental health and depression for patients 12-17 years of age. We are slightly lower than Minnesota but all three counties are over 80%. Early screening plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing mental health issues promptly, leading to better outcomes for our youth.

A program that does a really good job catching problems early is the Child and Teen Checkups (C&TC) program. C&TC are regular health checkups for kids and teens on Medicaid, making sure they stay healthy. These checkups include:

-   Health History and Physical Exam: Checking overall health and growth.

-   Vaccinations: Getting necessary shots.

-   Vision and Hearing Tests: Making sure eyes and ears are working well.

-   Dental Checkups: Regular visits to the dentist.

-   Developmental Screenings: Checking for any developmental issues.

-   Health Education: Learning about healthy habits.

For kids aged 0-20, these checkups happen regularly, and for those aged 3-20, they include yearly checkups. We capture and store data on our performance with C&TC. Although both age groups (0-20 and 3-20) have not quite returned to pre-COVID-19 numbers, we are confident we will get there.

In terms of community support, Mahnomen County saw a positive change of 12.3% in students feeling that the community cared for them "quite a bit" or "very much." Conversely, Polk County experienced a 13.5% decrease in this sentiment.

Another critical area for improvement across Minnesota is the fight against drug use. The Minnesota Student Survey helps us identify early signs of possible problematic behavior in our youth. For instance, we can see that 60.8% of 11th graders in Polk County reported not using alcohol, marijuana, or drugs within the last year. Unfortunately, we currently lack data on how well Mahnomen and Norman Counties are doing in this area.

### Drug use

Polk, Norman, and Mahnmoen did not experience a big change from 2022 to 2023 in prescription rates per 1,000 residents according to the Prescription Drug Monitoring Dashboard provided by Minnesota's Board of Pharmacy. Prescription rates enable us to compare how our counties measure up against each other. Out of the three counties, Mahnomen has the highest prescription rate per 1000 residents. Mahnomen also had the highest Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) rate (52.3) and age-adjusted nonfatal drug overdose rate per 1,000 residents (9.8). Both NAS and nonfatal drug overdoses are significantly higher for Mahnomen when compared to Minnesota.

Comparing the fatal drug overdose data (page 60) can be challenging because it is currently presented as counts rather than rates. Instead of comparing these counts across counties, we should focus on the impact each count has on the community. Over the span of about nine years, the state of Minnesota lost 8,991 people to drug overdoses. Polk County experienced 34 fatalities, Norman County had 4, and Mahnomen County lost 43. Although it's easy to get lost in the data and numbers, when we remember that these are lives we're dealing with, we start to appreciate the importance of the work we do and the good that exists in our communities.

We currently do not know the age of the individuals who died by overdose. However, a good measure for how our communities are doing is years of potential life lost. Premature death is defined as dying before the age of 75 years of age. When we look at potential life years lost (dying before 75), Mahnomen is almost three times more than Polk, Norman, and the state of Minnesota. There can be multiple reasons for why this is significantly higher but the main point is that it is so much higher.

In addition to addressing drug overdoses, it's important to consider other significant public health concerns such as binge drinking and smoking. These behaviors can also contribute to premature death and years of potential life lost. By examining the data on binge drinking and smoking, we can better understand their impact on our communities and develop strategies to mitigate these risks

### Behvaioral Factors

Behavioral factors play a crucial role in determining the overall health and well-being of a community. These factors include habits and behaviors that can either positively or negatively impact health outcomes. In this section, we will explore several key behavioral factors that significantly affect our population:

Binge Drinking Among Adults: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of health issues, including liver disease, cardiovascular problems, and increased risk of accidents and injuries. Understanding the prevalence of binge drinking helps us address its impact on public health.

Percentage of Mothers Who Smoke: Smoking during pregnancy poses serious risks to both the mother and the unborn child, including low birth weight, preterm birth, and developmental issues. Monitoring smoking rates among mothers is essential for promoting healthier pregnancies and better outcomes for infants.

Current Cigarette Smoking Among Adults: Smoking remains a leading cause of preventable diseases and deaths. By examining current smoking rates, we can identify trends and target interventions to reduce smoking-related health problems.

STI/HIV: The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV is a critical public health concern. Effective prevention, testing, and treatment strategies are necessary to control the spread of these infections and improve the health of affected individuals.

By analyzing these behavioral factors, we can gain valuable insights into the health challenges faced by our community and develop targeted strategies to promote healthier behaviors and improve overall health outcomes.

On the next page, you will see that binge drinking rates are consistent across our three counties and the state of Minnesota. Approximately 1 in 5 people in Minnesota and our communities engage in binge drinking.

While Mahnomen County has a higher percentage of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, it is encouraging to see a significant decline in smoking during pregnancy from 2021 to 2022 in Mahnomen. Changing any habit is challenging and maintaining these changes takes time which is why it is so great to see this decrease.

However, it is important to note that Mahnomen County also has a significantly higher smoking rate among all adults compared to the other counties.

As we continue to address these behavioral factors, it's also crucial to focus on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. These public health concerns require our attention to ensure effective prevention, testing, and treatment strategies. Let's now examine the data on STIs and HIV in our counties to understand their impact and how we can improve health outcomes in this area.

Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis data in this report should only be compared to the county it pertains to since these are counts. What is also difficult with counts even when looking at the impact internally, is counts don't factor in population growth or decline. However, counts do provide us with insight of the actual impact for if someone gets an STI or HIV. Polk County experienced an increase in Chlamydia cases from 2022 to 2023. Norman and Mahnomen nearly had no cases of gonorrhea in 2023. Syphilis we say a decline in Polk County and an increase in Mahnomen County.

We are able to compare prevalence more reliable than counts. Polk County has the highest percentage of HIV in relation to Norman and Mahnomen. Mahnomen and Polk County's experience a new HIV case (incidence) in 2023.

In addition to addressing STIs and HIV, it's essential to focus on preventive measures such as vaccinations and prenatal care. Vaccinations play a critical role in preventing infectious diseases and maintaining public health. Ensuring that pregnant women receive adequate prenatal care is equally important for the health of both the mother and the baby. Let's explore the data on vaccination rates and prenatal care in our counties to understand how well we are performing in these areas and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Vaccines

According to Minnesota Department of Health, childhood and adolescent vaccination rates decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthy People (HP) 2030 Goal is to increase vaccination rates. Infants and children need to get vaccinated to prevent diseases like hepatitis, measles, and pertussis. Teaching people about the importance of vaccines, sending vaccination reminders, and making it easier to get vaccines can help increase vaccination rates in children, adolescents, and adults. The following map and the next plot/table use the same data but just display it differently.

Minnesota, Norman County, and Mahnomen County all experienced declines in vaccination rates for the seven vaccine series, DTaP, Hep A, Hep B, Hib, MMR, PCV, Polio, Rotovirus, and Varicella. Polk County improved their vaccination rate for Varicella, Rotovirus, Polio, MMR, Hep B, DTaP, and the seven vaccine series.

### Prenatal Care

Prenatal care is essential for ensuring the health and well-being of both mothers and their babies. Adequate prenatal care helps to monitor the progress of the pregnancy, identify and manage potential health issues, and provide important health education to expectant mothers. Here, we examine the data on late or inadequate prenatal care (PNC) for mothers in Minnesota and our counties.

-   Minnesota: The state of Minnesota saw a decrease in the percentage of mothers receiving late or inadequate prenatal care, from 5.6% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, representing a 1.2% improvement.

-   Polk County: Polk County also experienced a significant improvement, with the rate decreasing from 8.3% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2022, a 2.4% improvement.

-   Norman County: Data for Norman County is not available for both years. I believe this may be due to suppression rules for not having enough data because the majority of Norman births happen out of state more than like in North Dakota.

-   Mahnomen County: Mahnomen County had the highest rates of late or inadequate prenatal care, but it also saw the most substantial improvement, decreasing from 41.8% in 2021 to 32.6% in 2022, a 9.2% improvement.

These improvements are encouraging, especially in Mahnomen County, which had the highest initial rates but also the most significant reduction. Ensuring that all expectant mothers receive timely and adequate prenatal care is crucial for the health of both mothers and their babies. Continued efforts to improve access to and the quality of prenatal care will help further reduce these rates and improve health outcomes across our communities.

## Primary Care Providers and Dental Services:

Access to comprehensive health care services, including primary care and dental care, is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. Primary care providers play a critical role in early detection, prevention, and management of various health conditions. They offer a wide range of services, from routine check-ups and immunizations to managing chronic diseases and coordinating specialist care.

Similarly, dental services are vital for preventing and treating oral health issues, which can significantly impact overall health. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. Dentists also provide essential education on maintaining good oral hygiene practices.

Improving access to these services can lead to better health outcomes for our communities. Efforts to increase the availability of primary care providers and dentists, especially in underserved regions, are crucial. This includes initiatives to attract and retain healthcare professionals in rural areas, expanding telehealth services, and ensuring affordable care for all residents.

**Population per Primary Care Provider (2022)** - Minnesota: 1,133 people per primary care provider.

-   Norman County: Data not available (NA).

-   Polk County: 1,809 people per primary care provider.

-   Mahnomen County: 5,414 people per primary care provider.

This indicates that, on average, Minnesota has 1,133 people per primary care provider, which suggests relatively good access to primary care across the state. Polk County has a higher ratio of 1,809 people per provider, indicating less access compared to the state average. Mahnomen County has the highest ratio with 5,414 people per provider, suggesting significantly less access to primary care services.

**Population per Dentist (2022)** - Minnesota: 1,287 people per dentist

-   Mahnomen County: Data not available (NA)

-   Norman County: 1,594 people per dentist

-   Polk County: 2,195 people per dentist

This data suggests that, on average, Minnesota has 1,287 people per dentist, indicating relatively good access to dental care across the state. Norman County has a slightly higher ratio of 1,594 people per dentist, suggesting less access compared to the state average. Polk County has the highest ratio with 2,195 people per dentist, indicating significantly less access to dental care services.

Even with potentially less access to primary care providers, the age-adjusted prevalence for having routine checkups is similar to the state average in Minnesota. About 3 out of 4 people are predicted to get their routine checkups. However, the consistency is not as strong for Medicaid beneficiaries receiving dental services. Assessing current performance is challenging due to lagging data and significant fluctuations in historical data.

## Diabetes, Obesity, and Physical Activity Data

Our local challenges in healthcare access and service consistency are further reflected in the broader health metrics for the state, such as diabetes, obesity, and physical activity levels.

The age-adjusted prevalence for diabetes is similar between Minnesota, Norman, and Polk. However, Mahnomen does have a higher prevalence of diabetes than Polk County and Norman County. The hope woule be that all three counties would be doing reasonably well in the optimal diabetic care. However, we are lower compared to Minnesota.

Optimal diabetic care consists of controlling ones blood pressure (less than 140/90 mmHg), maintaining ones HbA1c ( \< 8.0 mg/dL), taking a statin if its tollorated, a non-tobacco user, and being on a daily aspirin if the patient has ischemic vascular disease @puf2022. his care is specifically targeted at patients aged 18-75.

Similarly, the patterns observed in physical activity and obesity among adults mirror those seen in diabetes prevalence. Mahnomen County, in particular, has a higher age-adjusted prevalence of no leisure-time physical activity and obesity compared to the rest of the group.
