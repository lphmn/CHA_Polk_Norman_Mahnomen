## Polk-Norman-Mahnomen (CHS) Risk Assessment (2024)

The Polk-Norman-Mahnomen (PNM) Public Health Risk Assessment (2024) was conducted to identify and prioritize the most significant public health threats facing Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen Counties. The purpose of this assessment is to guide health and emergency response efforts, ensuring communities are better prepared for future hazards. The assessment combined quantitative data from a variety of sources, with qualitative insights gathered from stakeholder surveys and facilitated discussions. This dual approach ensures that both data and frontline perspectives inform public health strategies to strengthen resilience. Partners - The assessment was made possible through the collaboration of key stakeholders, including healthcare providers, long-term care facilities, behavioral health organizations, county and city emergency services, and emergency managers. Their expertise provided critical insights into the diverse challenges impacting the region.

Top 5 Public Health Hazards - Based on the survey results and facilitated discussions, the top five public health threats identified for Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen Counties are:

1.  Critical Healthcare Staff Shortage -- This hazard poses a significant challenge to the availability and delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural areas.
2.  Behavioral Health Crisis (including Anxiety and Depression) -- Rising rates of mental health issues require expanded resources to meet increasing demand.
3.  Substance Abuse -- Opioid and alcohol misuse continues to be a critical concern, with gaps in current resources and treatment options.
4.  Ice Storm/Blizzard (including Extreme Cold) -- Severe winter weather presents ongoing risks to infrastructure, transportation, and public safety.
5.  Cyber Threats -- Increasing cyberattacks on healthcare and public systems demand stronger cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure.

## Minnesota Student Survey

The Minnesota Student Survey (MSS) is an important source of information about the health, wellbeing, safety, and academic success of Minnesota's youth. The anonymous and confidential statewide school-based survey is administered every three years to students in grades 5, 8, 9 and 11. The survey includes questions about a wide variety of youth behaviors, including risk behaviors such as physical activity, nutrition, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, mental health, school safety, relationships and sexual activity, as well as positive behaviors and connection to family, school and community. Most Minnesota school districts actively participate in the MSS. While some schools or certain grades in Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen Counties were not involved in the 2022 MSS, many others contributed to its success. We encourage and invite all schools in Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen Counties to participate in the upcoming 2025 MSS. The survey results help bring the voices of young people into decisions about policy, programming, and services for our students.
