### Data Transparency and Reproducibility
We used the most up-to-date publicly available data for the following reasons:
⦁	Reproducibility: While some data for our CHA required a data request, most of the report relies on publicly available data. This allows other community health boards and researchers to reproduce our work if they wish, aiding in fact-checking.
⦁	Transparency: Using publicly available data allows us to be as transparent as possible.
⦁	Efficiency: By using publicly available data, we can save time and resources for our federal and state data stewards.
