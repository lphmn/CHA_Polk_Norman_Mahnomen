    "text": "Introduction\nThe Polk-Norman-Mahnomen Community Health Board (PNM CHB), governed by seven-members, is a multi-county community health services (CHS) entity responsible to provide local governmental public health services. Through delegation and sharing agreements, all powers and duties are delegated to the two-member health departments, Polk County Public Health and Norman-Mahnomen Public Health. We are pleased to present the 2022-2024 Community Health Assessment (CHA) to better understand health issues facing the communities of Polk, Norman and Mahnomen Counties.\nThe Community Health Assessment provides a quantitative and qualitative data snapshot of the factors that impact health of the people living in the communities which the PNM CHB serves. Over the past two years, together with community partners, we have collaboratively supported partner Community Health Needs Assessments and Community Needs Assessments, while collecting and prioritizing data from local, state and national sources as well as input from public health surveys and conversations with community members who have knowledge or expertise in public health and/or are experience health inequities. PNM CHS followed a modified version of the Community Health Improvement Framework “Mobilizing Action for Planning and Partnership” (MAPP) to gather information and develop a Community Health Assessment (CHA) revealing the most pressing health needs across the service area. The data collected was limited by the availability of county-level data, community input, survey responses, and time. Through this framework, a structured, focused discussion through consideration of data, participant’s reaction and responses, possible solutions and agreed future strategies was utilized among community health partners. Findings from the CHA are used to identify, develop, and target strategies to improve health challenges in the community. Facilitated by public health leaders and strategists, this framework, paired with Results Based Accountability, helps communities apply strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify community driven solutions and resources for collective action. The Community Health Assessment is intended to be a living document which will be updated as additional data becomes available. We encourage the use of this assessment as a starting place for understanding the health of our communities, working to increase health and wellbeing, and planning for the future.\n\n\nThank you to the individuals, organization, and partners who have been involved throughout the health assessment and planning process. A special thank you to Patrick Olson, Data Analyst, for assisting PNM CHS with gathering data from a variety of state and national sources in the development of a more comprehensive Community Health Assessment to meet public health accreditation standards and measures, Assessment and Surveillance Foundational Public Health capability and inform meaningful local action.\nThank you to the community members and partners of Polk, Norman and Mahnomen Counties for participating in the community health surveys and conversations.\nWe welcome your continued feedback and engagement. Comments or questions regarding this report can be directed to: Sarah Reese, Polk-Norman-Mahnomen CHS Administrator at 218-281-3385.",

    "text": "Rationale Behind Our Choices\nIn today’s world, we can easily experience information overload. The Census Bureau alone provides millions of data points available for public use. If we use all the available Census Bureau data, our Community Health Assessment (CHA) would not be meaningful because we would be overwhelmed with data. Additionally, relying solely on one data source like the Census Bureau would cause us to miss important details provided by other high-quality sources.\nThe art of data involves reducing noise (achieving consistency or understanding the reasons for inconsistencies among different data sources). By reducing noise, we can better identify high-quality sources that provide the essential components for a comprehensive CHA. We aimed to select outcomes of interest that provide trend data (evaluated over multiple years) to track our historical performance and improvements in key areas. However, some outcomes are only shown for one year because they may be projected outcomes (based on statistical models) or the outcome definition changed over time, making it inappropriate/unreliable to display them over multiple years.\nWe used the most up-to-date publicly available data for the following reasons:\nAn important note for our CHA is that, due to the small populations in our three counties, we can’t always examine multiple factors at the same time. We know that health is affected by many things, but we don’t always have detailed information or enough people to break down the data in many ways. For example, if we wanted to study lung cancer and compare it between men and women, we might not have enough data to do this accurately because there aren’t enough people. While we might have enough data to look at rates of lung cancer for each county, we might not be able to analyze lung cancer rates by birth sex.",

The regional Hub provides coordinated foundational public health capability resources to consortium members where content expertise would lend support to regional efforts and local organizational professionals. The Data Analyst gathered secondary quantitative data obtained from national, state and local data sources. Data sources included, but were not limited to, the U.S. Census, Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC), the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (BRFSS), the Minnesota Student Survey and County Health Rankings. Local data obtained came from partners, such as healthcare and community action agency assessments and reports. Community health assessment data was utilized by Public Health to identify 50 community health issues. Community partners then were asked to select 1) what they considered to be the top ten issues currently impacting the community’s health; 2) how they defined community; and 3) an example or story of an asset, resource or service in community that supports health and well-being in a survey emailed out by Public Health staff.\nTop 10 Priority Health Issues:\n\nPoverty\nAccess to mental health care\nMental health & well-being\nDrug use/misuse & addiction\nChronic stress, anxiety and/or depression\nAccess to dental care\nEmployment & livable wages\nTransportation options -multimodal\nAccess to affordable foods\nAlcohol use/misuse and addiction",

    "text": "Data Interpretation\nWhen looking at data, it’s easy to assume one event causes another. For example, a rooster crowing doesn’t cause the sun to rise; they’re just associated. This is similar to health risk factors and medical conditions. Just because two things happen together doesn’t mean one causes the other.\nIn health, many factors can influence conditions. For example, high rates of a health condition don’t mean one specific factor is the cause. It could be due to a combination of lifestyle, environment, and genetics. By assessing how we are doing regarding multiple risk factors as well as the condition on interest, we can gain a comprehensive understanding and make better health decisions for our community.\nJust like the rooster and the sun, health risk factors might be associated with certain conditions, but they don’t necessarily cause them directly. Recognizing these associations helps us develop more effective health strategies with our communities. By examining our community’s health from quanitative and qualitative data sources, we can understand the factors and stand behind the data elaborate, identify opportunities, and strategies that are locally relevant. The following terms help in navigating and understanding the report more effectively.",

    "section": "Data Terms/Definitions",
    "text": "Data Terms/Definitions\n\nCount\n\nA count represents the value of an observation. Counts are useful for assessing the economic impact of a community and determining if statistical analysis is reliable. According to (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2024), counts less than 16 are considered unstable, meaning the results should be interpreted with caution. However, counts below 16 are still important because they provide us with a sense of how a community is currently doing. Counts shouldn’t be compared among different communities, but they can be used to assess the community.\n\n\n\nProportion\n\nA proportion is a type of ratio that compares a part to the whole. It is expressed as a fraction or percentage and helps us understand the relative size of a subset within a larger population. For example, if 20 out of 100 people in a community have a certain health condition, the proportion is 20%.\n\n\n\nCrude vs. Age-Adjusted Prevalence\n\nCrude Prevalence: Shows the overall condition in the general population but can be misleading if age distribution varies between communities. For example, an aging population may have a higher crude prevalence of heart disease simply because older adults can be more prone to this condition.\nAge-Adjusted Prevalence: Use this for comparing different communities as it accounts for age differences. It’s like comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges. By adjusting for age, we ensure a fair comparison between communities.\n\n\n\nImportance of Age-Adjusted Prevalence\nAge-adjusted prevalence allows fair comparisons by considering age differences in populations.\n\n\nConfidence Intervals (CI)\nCIs can be interpreted in two main ways.\n\nWhen looking at only one community. If a community had a CI of 5%-8%, this would mean we are 95% sure that the true number is as low as 5% and as high as 8% or somewhere in between.\nWhen comparing two communities.\n\n\nIf a community has a CI of 5%-8% and another community has a CI of 6%-9% for the same topic, these two communities are similar, and we cannot say one is definitely higher or lower than the other because the values overlap (6% falls between 5%-8%)\nIf a community has a CI of 5%-8% and another community has a CI of 10%-15%, these two communities would be significantly different because the values don’t overlap (5%-8% and 10%-15%) so we can say with 95% confidence that these values are different.",

    "text": "Healthcare and Dental Access\nAccess to comprehensive health care services, including primary care and dental care, is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. Primary care providers play a critical role in early detection, prevention, and management of various health conditions. They offer a wide range of services, from routine check-ups and immunizations to managing chronic diseases and coordinating specialist care.\nSimilarly, dental services are vital for preventing and treating oral health issues, which can significantly impact overall health. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. Dentists also provide essential education on maintaining good oral hygiene practices.\nImproving access to these services can lead to better health outcomes for our communities. Efforts to increase the availability of primary care providers and dentists, especially in underserved regions, are crucial. This includes initiatives to attract and retain healthcare professionals in rural areas, expanding telehealth services, and ensuring affordable care for all residents. Through a partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota/Blue Plus, the PNM Dental Innovation Coordinator works on population based dental access innovations and helps residents seeking dental services. As part of this initiative, locations across the three counties now partner with Children’s Dental Services (CDS), a non profit dental health clinic, that offers onsite dental hygiene services. Increasing access to comprehensive, high-quality health care is a Healthy People 2030 Goal.\nPopulation per Primary Care Provider (2022) - Minnesota: 1,133 people per primary care provider.\n\nNorman County: Data not available (NA).\nPolk County: 1,809 people per primary care provider.\nMahnomen County: 5,414 people per primary care provider.\n\nThis indicates that, on average, Minnesota has 1,133 people per primary care provider, which suggests relatively good access to primary care across the state. Polk County has a higher ratio of 1,809 people per provider, indicating less access compared to the state average. Mahnomen County has the highest ratio with 5,414 people per provider, suggesting significantly less access to primary care services.\nPopulation per Dentist (2022) - Minnesota: 1,287 people per dentist\n\nMahnomen County: Data not available (NA)\nNorman County: 1,594 people per dentist\nPolk County: 2,195 people per dentist\n\nThis data suggests that, on average, Minnesota has 1,287 people per dentist, indicating relatively good access to dental care across the state. Norman County has a slightly higher ratio of 1,594 people per dentist, suggesting less access compared to the state average. Polk County has the highest ratio with 2,195 people per dentist, indicating significantly less access to dental care services.\nEven with potentially less access to primary care providers, the age-adjusted prevalence for having routine checkups is similar to the state average in Minnesota. About 3 out of 4 people are predicted to get their routine checkups. However, the consistency is not as strong for Medicaid beneficiaries receiving dental services.

    "text": "Years of Potential Lost\nA good measure for how our communities are doing is years of potential life lost (YPLL). Premature death is defined as dying before the age of 75. When we look at potential life years lost (dying before 75), Mahnomen County’s rate is almost three times higher than those of Polk County, Norman County, and the state of Minnesota.\nThere can be multiple reasons for why this is significantly higher in Mahnomen County. Factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, prevalence of chronic diseases, and lifestyle choices all play a role. Additionally, disparities in education, employment opportunities, and environmental conditions can contribute to higher rates of premature death.\nThe main point is that Mahnomen County’s YPLL is alarmingly high, indicating a critical need for targeted interventions. Improving healthcare access, promoting healthy lifestyles, and addressing social determinants of health are essential steps to reduce premature deaths and improve overall community well-being. Addressing these issues requires a collaborative effort from local governments, healthcare providers, and community organizations. By focusing on preventive measures, early detection, and effective treatment of chronic conditions, we can work towards reducing the years of potential life lost and enhancing the quality of life for all of our residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute (2024)\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL): Death &lt; 75",

    "text": "Adverse Childhood Experiences\nAdverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs, are preventable, potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (0-17 years) such as neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, and having a family member attempt or die by suicide. Also included are aspects of a child’s environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding, such as growing up in a household with substance use; mental health problems; or instability due to parental separation or incarceration of a parent, sibling or other member of the household. (CDC, 2019; Felitti et al.,) Adverse childhood experiences can increase a person’s risk for chronic stress and adverse coping mechanisms and result in lifelong chronic illness such as depression, heart disease, obesity and substance abuse.\nWe were able to obtain ACE’s data from Minnesota’s Department of Education Minnesota Student Survey Reports 2013-2022 tool. The ACE’S data consisted of the following questions:\n\nDo you live with anyone who drinks too much alcohol? See Table 4.1.\nDo you live with anyone who is depressed or has any other mental health issues? See Table 4.2.\nDo you live with anyone who uses illegal drugs or abuses prescription drugs? See Table 4.3.\nDoes a parent or other adult in your home regularly swear at you, insult you or put you down? See Table 4.4.\nHas a parent or other adult in your home ever hit, beat, kicked or physically hurt you in any way? See Table 4.5.\nHas any relative/family member ever pressured, tricked, or forced you to do something sexual or done something sexual to you? See Table 4.6.\nHas anyone who was not a relative/family member ever pressured, tricked, or forced you to do something sexual or done something sexual to you against your wishes? Table 4.7\nHave your parents or other adults in your home ever slapped, hit, kicked, punched or beat each other up? See Table 4.8.\n\nPolk County’s data remained fairly consistent when comparing 2019 to 2022 for the same grade levels. However, Table 4.5 indicates an increase in 11th graders living with someone who has mental health issues from 2019 to 2022. Interpreting this change is challenging. On one hand, preventing mental health issues is crucial. On the other hand, increased openness and reduced stigma around mental health might explain the rise, suggesting a more supportive environment.\nInterpreting the data for Norman County and Mahnomen County is challenging due to their smaller populations. As noted in the “Understanding Our CHA” section, low data totals can complicate analysis. To address this, we can either combine grades or aggregate data across multiple years. However, due to limited time and data, we were unable to take this next step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Percent who lives with anyone who drinks too much alcohol\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n8.9%\n10.2%\n9.2%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n9.2%\n10.0%\n11.6%\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n15.2%*\n0\n18.5%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n10.9%*\n6.5%*\n18.9%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Percent living with someone with mental health issues\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n22.9%\n25%\n27.3%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n21.5%\n26.0%\n35.3%\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n34.3%\n0\n33.3%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n21.8%*\n39.0%\n29.7%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Percent Who Lives with Anyone Using Illegal or Abusing Prescription Drugs\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n5.4%*\n5.3%*\n8.1%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n2.2%*\n4.4%*\n4.2%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n7.7%*\n0\n0\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n3.7%*\n12.0%*\n10.8%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Percent with Verbally Abusive Adults at Home\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n14.1%\n16.5%\n13.7%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n12.8%\n14.1%\n14.2%\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n14.9%*\n0\n22.2%\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n23.2%*\n23.4%\n10.8%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.5: Percent Physically Hurt by Household Adults\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n11.9%\n10.2%\n11.1%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n10.6%\n11.6%\n8.4%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n19.7%*\n0\n11.5%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n11.5%\n14.7%\n13.5%\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.6: Percent With Family Member Who Pressured or Forced Sexual Activity\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n1.6%*\n3.9%*\n4.1%*\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n2.6%*\n4.0%*\n3.2%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n3.1%*\n0\n15.4%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n0\n4.1%*\n5.4%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.7: Percent With Non-Relative Who Pressured or Forced Sexual Activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n3.8%*\n6.0%*\n7.4%*\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n8.4%\n10.4%\n7.9%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n1.5%*\n0\n7.4*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n2%*\n8%*\n8.1%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.8: Percent with Parents/Adults in Home Who Physically Fought\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nYear\n8th Grade\n9th Grade\n11th Grade\n\n\n\n\nPolk County\n2019\n7.7%\n6.7%\n8.5%\n\n\nPolk County\n2022\n7.9%\n6.8%*\n11.1%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2019\n16.7%*\n0\n22.2%*\n\n\nNorman County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2019\n14.8%*\n14.5%*\n13.5%*\n\n\nMahnomen County\n2022\n__\n__\n__\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Count &lt; 18 __ No data available\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. 2024. “PLACES: Local Data for Better Health.” https://www.cdc.gov/places.\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/ Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program. 2022. “CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index 2022 Database u.s.” https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html.\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development. 2015-2023. “Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) Tool.” https://apps.deed.state.mn.us/lmi/laus/Default.aspx.\n\n\n———. 2024. “Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) Tool.” https://mn.gov/deed/data/data-tools/county-profiles/.\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Health. 2012-2020. “Oral Health Query:medicaid Dental Service Use.

    "text": "Rate of Natural Increase\nThe birth rate and death rate are fundamental demographic indicators that provide insights into the population dynamics of a region. The birth rate measures the number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year, while the death rate measures the number of deaths per 1,000 people in the same period. The difference between these two rates is known as the natural increase (or decrease, if deaths exceed births), which indicates the growth or decline of a population excluding migration.\nNatural increase is a crucial component of population change, but it does not account for the movement of people into or out of a region. Migration can significantly impact population size and composition, often overshadowing natural increase. For instance, a region with a high birth rate and low death rate might still experience population decline if a large number of people move away. Conversely, areas with low natural increase might grow rapidly due to high levels of immigration.\nIn 2020, Polk County, Norman County, and Mahnomen County all experienced a natural decrease, likely due to the impact of COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly influenced both birth and death rates, with increased mortality and potential delays in births due to economic and health uncertainties.\nAmong these counties, Mahnomen consistently has the highest birth rate, reflecting a younger population or higher fertility rates. In contrast, Norman County has the highest death rate, which could be attributed to an older population or other health factors.\nOver the years, Mahnomen County has generally maintained a positive natural increase, while Polk and Norman Counties have struggled with higher death rates (Minnesota Department of Health 2015-2020). These trends highlight the need for targeted public health interventions and policies to support population growth and health in these regions.\nLooking ahead, it will be important to monitor these trends and implement measures to mitigate the long-term impacts of the pandemic. Public health initiatives, economic support, and healthcare improvements could help stabilize and improve the natural increase rates in these counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolk County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n13.2\n11.4\n1.8\n2015\n\n\n14.2\n11.4\n2.8\n2016\n\n\n13.7\n10.8\n2.9\n2017\n\n\n13.8\n11.6\n2.2\n2018\n\n\n11.7\n11.8\n-0.1\n2019\n\n\n12.1\n13.7\n-1.6\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n11.1\n15.6\n-4.5\n2015\n\n\n11.2\n15.6\n-4.4\n2016\n\n\n12.6\n17.4\n-4.8\n2017\n\n\n12.5\n16.1\n-3.6\n2018\n\n\n10.8\n13.8\n-3\n2019\n\n\n9.5\n12.3\n-2.8\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMahnomen County Natural Rate of Increase\n\n\nBirth Rate\nDeath Rate\nNatural Increase\nYear\n\n\n\n\n17.2\n11.2\n6\n2015\n\n\n20.9\n11.2\n9.7\n2016\n\n\n17.7\n14.3\n3.4\n2017\n\n\n16.3\n12.7\n3.6\n2018\n\n\n17.7\n11.9\n5.8\n2019\n\n\n14.3\n14.4\n-0.1\n2020",

    "text": "Substance Use and Misuse\nWhile most youth enjoy good health, some are at increased risk for behaviors that can lead to poor health outcomes. Notably, many adults with substance abuse disorders and addictions began their struggles during adolescence and young adulthood.\nMahnomen County stands out with the highest rates of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) at 52.3 per 1,000 live births and nonfatal drug overdoses at 9.8 per 1,000 residents. These rates are significantly higher than the state averages for Minnesota.\nComparing fatal drug overdose data across counties can be challenging due to its presentation as raw counts rather than rates. Instead of focusing solely on these counts, we should consider the profound impact each loss has on the community. Over approximately nine years, Minnesota lost 8,991 individuals to drug overdoses. Polk County experienced 34 fatalities, Norman County had 4, and Mahnomen County lost 43. These numbers remind us that behind every statistic is a life, underscoring the importance of our work and the positive changes we strive to bring to our communities.\nBeyond drug overdoses, other significant public health concerns include binge drinking and smoking. These behaviors also contribute to premature death and years of potential life lost. By examining data on binge drinking and smoking, we can better understand their impact on our communities and develop effective strategies to mitigate these risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Minnesota Department of Health (2023a)\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Minnesota Department of Health (2023b)\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Nonfatal Drug Overdose Age−Adjusted Rate (per 1,000 Residents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source: Minnesota Department of Health (2024a)\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Number of Fatal Drug Overdoses by County of Residence\n\n\n\n\nPolk-Norman-Mahnomen Environmental Scan\nBetween May and June of 2023, forty-two alcohol retailers were contacted to better understand what youth in our area are seeing about THC, and to provide information to county officials and legislators following cannabis legalization.\n\nAll 42 establishments in the scan sold alcohol products (beer, wine, and/or hard liquor).\n18 establishments were within 1000 feet of a school or park/playground.\n36 advertised the sale of alcohol outside their establishment.\n13 had exterior signage regarding minimum purchase age, while 35 had interior signage regarding purchase age. Only 5 had signage related to the health risks of drinking alcohol.\nSeven establishments were found to sell THC products (1 liquor store, 1 vape shop, 5 bars/bar and grills)\n\n\n\nSuccesses\nRelationship Building: Most retailers were welcoming and appreciative of the scan. Building and continuing relationships with alcohol and THC retailers will strengthen PNM prevention efforts. There was also a high interest in RBST, as a value add for the business and to increase positive engagement with public health and law enforcement.\n\n\nMinimum Purchase Age\nMost establishments had clear signage indicating only persons 21 years of age and older are allowed in the bar area and that they check identification. 80% of establishments had interior signage about minimum purchase age of alcohol.\n\n\nPolk County Opioid Funding Prioritization Survey\nThe Polk County Opioid Funding Prioritization Survey gathered input from community members to guide the allocation of over $3 million from the national opioid settlement. The survey, conducted from June 12 to July 24, 2023, received 137 responses, with a majority prioritizing prevention, treatment, and recovery support. Key areas identified for funding include primary prevention, community development, and treatment expansion. The survey also highlighted the importance of harm reduction strategies such as overdose reversal and social detox.

As of January 1, 2021, an estimated 316,110 Minnesota residents were living with a history of malignant cancer, representing 5.5% of the state’s population. In our local counties, the prevalence is even higher.

Additionally, the age-adjusted rates of specific cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, provide further insight into the burden of this disease. For example, Mahnomen County has the highest age-adjusted rate of lung cancer at 62.7 per 100,000 people, while Polk County has the highest rate of breast cancer at 146.3 per 100,000 people.\nBy understanding the prevalence and impact of cancer in our communities, we can better tailor our efforts to support those affected and work towards reducing the incidence and mortality associated with this disease.\n\nPersons living with a history of of cancer by Location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nNumber of Persons Living\nwith a History of of Cancer\nPercent of Population Living\nwith a History of Cancer\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota\n3,16,110\n5.5%\n\n\nPolk\n1,880\n6.1%\n\n\nNorman\n470\n7.3%\n\n\nMahnomen\n370\n6.9%\n\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Health (2024a)\n\nCancer Age Adjusted Rate per 100,000 people 2015-2019\n\n\nLocation\nLung Cancer\nBreast Cancer\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota\n52\n136\n\n\nPolk\n57.8\n146.3\n\n\nNorman\n49.3\n109.2\n\n\nMahnomen\n62.7\n133.7\n\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Health (2023)",

    "text": "Asthma\nAsthma is a chronic disease of the airways that makes breathing difficult. Asthma causes inflammation or swelling, and a narrowing of the airways making it more difficult to breathe. Irritated cells in the airways make more mucus than usual narrowing the tiny airways. Mucus is a normally a protective, sticky liquid that helps shield your lungs from irritants like dust, bacteria and smoke.\nDuring normal breathing, air flows freely in and out of the lungs. However, during an asthma attack or episode, swelling of the airway’s lining increases, muscles surrounding the airways tighten, and thick mucus clogs the tiny airways making it difficult to breathe. Asthma affects people of all ages and while it can start in adulthood, it most often starts during childhood.\nChildren, teens, and adults now spend up to 90% of their time indoors, and at least 50% of that time is spent in their home. Because of the large amount of time spent indoors, the home environment is an important focus for reducing exposures to triggers of asthma. Triggers of asthma found in the home include allergens such as pet dander, mold, or pests as well as irritants such as scented cleaning products and second hand smoke.

Mahnomen County had the highest percentage of 9th graders responding ‘yes’ to this question.\nA very encouraging sign is Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen counties appear to be doing well in screening for mental health and depression for patients 12-17 years of age. We are slightly lower than Minnesota but all three counties are over 80%. Early screening plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing mental health issues promptly, leading to better outcomes for our youth.\nIn terms of community support, Mahnomen County saw a positive change of 12.3% in students feeling that the community cared for them “quite a bit” or “very much.” Conversely, Polk County experienced a 13.5% decrease in this sentiment.\nThe Minnesota Student Survey helps us identify early signs of possible problematic behavior in our youth. For instance, we can see that 60.8% of 11th graders in Polk County reported not using alcohol, marijuana, or drugs within the last year. Unfortunately, we currently lack data on how well Mahnomen and Norman Counties are doing in this area.\nRegarding social isolation, the feeling of being socially isolated among adults was not significantly different between the counties, PNM CHS, or Minnesota, based on the age-adjusted 95% confidence interval.",
