    "text": "Introduction\nThe Polk-Norman-Mahnomen Community Health Board (PNM CHB), governed by seven-members, is a multi-county community health services (CHS) entity responsible to provide local governmental public health services. Through delegation and sharing agreements, all powers and duties are delegated to the two-member health departments, Polk County Public Health and Norman-Mahnomen Public Health. We are pleased to present the 2022-2024 Community Health Assessment (CHA) to better understand health issues facing the communities of Polk, Norman and Mahnomen Counties.\nThe Community Health Assessment provides a quantitative and qualitative data snapshot of the factors that impact health of the people living in the communities which the PNM CHB serves. Over the past two years, together with community partners, we have collaboratively supported partner Community Health Needs Assessments and Community Needs Assessments, while collecting and prioritizing data from local, state and national sources as well as input from public health surveys and conversations with community members who have knowledge or expertise in public health and/or are experience health inequities. PNM CHS followed a modified version of the Community Health Improvement Framework “Mobilizing Action for Planning and Partnership” (MAPP) to gather information and develop a Community Health Assessment (CHA) revealing the most pressing health needs across the service area. The data collected was limited by the availability of county-level data, community input, survey responses, and time. Through this framework, a structured, focused discussion through consideration of data, participant’s reaction and responses, possible solutions and agreed future strategies was utilized among community health partners. Findings from the CHA are used to identify, develop, and target strategies to improve health challenges in the community. Facilitated by public health leaders and strategists, this framework, paired with Results Based Accountability, helps communities apply strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify community driven solutions and resources for collective action. The Community Health Assessment is intended to be a living document which will be updated as additional data becomes available. We encourage the use of this assessment as a starting place for understanding the health of our communities, working to increase health and wellbeing, and planning for the future.\n\n\nThank you to the individuals, organization, and partners who have been involved throughout the health assessment and planning process. A special thank you to Patrick Olson, Data Analyst, for assisting PNM CHS with gathering data from a variety of state and national sources in the development of a more comprehensive Community Health Assessment to meet public health accreditation standards and measures, Assessment and Surveillance Foundational Public Health capability and inform meaningful local action.\nThank you to the community members and partners of Polk, Norman and Mahnomen Counties for participating in the community health surveys and conversations.\nWe welcome your continued feedback and engagement. Comments or questions regarding this report can be direct to: Sarah Reese, Polk-Norman-Mahnomen CHS Administrator at 218-281-3385.",

    "text": "Rationale Behind Our Choices\nIn today’s world, we can easily experience information overload. The Census Bureau alone provides millions of data points available for public use. If we use all the available Census Bureau data, our Community Health Assessment (CHA) would not be meaningful because we would be overwhelmed with data. Additionally, relying solely on one data source like the Census Bureau would cause us to miss important details provided by other high-quality sources.\nAttempting to include data on every health topic from all public sources would create an overly extensive report, making it challenging to navigate and use effectively. This is why we concentrated on data required for our certification, sourcing highly reputable information, and incorporating local feedback to inform our CHA. We made a concerted effort to identify risk factors associated with our outcomes of interest, understanding that, while we cannot prevent all outcomes, addressing risk factors may help us achieve better results.\nThe art of data involves reducing noise (achieving consistency or understanding the reasons for inconsistencies among different data sources). By reducing noise, we can better identify high-quality sources that provide the essential components for a comprehensive CHA. We aimed to select outcomes of interest that provide trend data (evaluated over multiple years) to track our historical performance and improvements in key areas. However, some outcomes are only shown for one year because they may be projected outcomes (based on statistical models) or the outcome definition changed over time, making it inappropriate/unreliable to display them over multiple years.\nWe tried to use the most up-to-date publicly available data for the following reasons:\nAn important note for our CHA is that, due to the small populations in our three counties, we can’t always examine multiple factors at the same time. We know that health is affected by many things, but we don’t always have detailed information or enough people to break down the data in many ways. For example, if we wanted to study lung cancer and compare it between men and women, we might not have enough data to do this accurately because there aren’t enough people. While we might have enough data to look at rates of lung cancer for each county, we might not be able to analyze lung cancer rates by birth sex.",

    "text": "Reproducibility: While some data for our CHA required a data request, most of the report relies on publicly available data. This allows other community health boards and researchers to reproduce our work if they wish, aiding in fact-checking our CHA.\nTransparency: Using publicly available data allows us to be as transparent as possible. We hope that our understanding of our community, as well as the community’s understanding of itself, aligns with the information shared publicly by Federal and State agencies.\nEfficiency: By using publicly available data, we can save time and resources for our federal and state data stewards. They don’t need to fulfill data requests for us, and it allows us to share the valuable work they’ve already done, rather than reinventing the wheel.",

    "section": "Data Interpretation",
    "text": "Data Interpretation\nWhen looking at data, it’s easy to assume one event causes another. For example, a rooster crowing doesn’t cause the sun to rise; they’re just associated. This is similar to health risk factors and medical conditions. Just because two things happen together doesn’t mean one causes the other.\nIn health, many factors can influence conditions. For example, high rates of a health condition don’t mean one specific factor is the cause. It could be due to a combination of lifestyle, environment, and genetics. By assessing how we are doing regarding multiple risk factors as well as the condition on interest, we can gain a comprehensive understanding and make better health decisions for our community.\nJust like the rooster and the sun, health risk factors might be associated with certain conditions, but they don’t necessarily cause them directly. Recognizing these associations helps us develop more effective health strategies for our communities. By examining our community’s health from multiple data sources, we can plan to maintain strengths and address weaknesses. The following terms should help in navigating and understanding the report more effectively.",

    "section": "Data Terms/Definations",
    "text": "Data Terms/Definations\n\nCount\n\nA count represents the value of an observation. Counts are useful for assessing the economic impact of a community and determining if statistical analysis is reliable. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2024), counts less than 16 are considered unstable, meaning the results should be interpreted with caution. However, counts below 16 are still important because they provide us with a sense of how a community is currently doing. Counts shouldn’t be compared among different communities, but they can be used to assess the community.\n\n\n\nProportion\n\nA proportion is a type of ratio that compares a part to the whole. It is expressed as a fraction or percentage and helps us understand the relative size of a subset within a larger population. For example, if 20 out of 100 people in a community have a certain health condition, the proportion is 20%.\n\n\n\nCrude vs. Age-Adjusted Prevalence\n\nCrude Prevalence: Shows the overall condition in the general population but can be misleading if age distribution varies between communities. For example, an aging population may have a higher crude prevalence of heart disease simply because older adults can be more prone to this condition.\nAge-Adjusted Prevalence: Use this for comparing different communities as it accounts for age differences. It’s like comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges. By adjusting for age, we ensure a fair comparison between communities.\n\n\n\nImportance of Age-Adjusted Prevalence\nAge-adjusted prevalence allows fair comparisons by considering age differences in populations.\n\n\nConfidence Intervals (CI)\nCIs can be interpreted in two main ways.\n\nWhen looking at only one community. If a community had a CI of 5%-8%, this would mean we are 95% sure that the true number is as low as 5% and as high as 8% or somewhere in between.\nWhen comparing two communities.\n\n\nIf a community has a CI of 5%-8% and another community has a CI of 6%-9% for the same topic, these two communities are similar, and we cannot say one is definitely higher or lower than the other because the values overlap (6% falls between 5%-8%)\nIf a community has a CI of 5%-8% and another community has a CI of 10%-15%, these two communities would be significantly different because the values don’t overlap (5%-8% and 10%-15%) so we can say with 95% confidence that these values are different.",

The survey was completed by 855 adult individuals. Out of the 855 survey responses, 821 were included in the analysis as the remaining 34 respondents were not from the PNM region.\n“Poor” health status was primarily reported by White and Black or African American population.\nAbout 26% of people experienced delay in seeking professional help for mental health during pandemic and this was mainly because the mental health care was expensive, or they did not think that the problem was serious enough.\nMost reported reason for delay in obtaining oral health care were expense, unable to get an appointment and lack of insurance coverage.\n47% of survey respondents consume alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs. Stress (16%) and boredom (13%) are the primary reason for the increase in substance use since March 2020.\nMajority of respondents received health information from social media, family, friends, health officials or county media website and television news. However, about 37.63% doubted whether the source was trustworthy. 19% of people also had issue with understanding medical terms and about 12% did not know where to find health information.\nPeople with an annual income less than $20k and between $35k-$49,999 mainly reported worsening of financial situation.\nAbout 8% survey respondents faced transportation issue and they reported to be from 25-44 years of age.",

Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS had a total residential population of 43,044. This makes up 0.75% of Minnesota’s population (43,044/5,706,494).\n\nPolk county is the largest of the three counties, with a population of 31,192 residents. This represents 72.47% of the total population (31,192 out of 43,044) for the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area. In relation to the state of Minnesota, Polk county accounts for 0.55% of the population (31,192 out of 5,706,494).\nNorman county has 6,441 residents, making up 14.96% (6,441 out of 43,044) of the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area.\nMahnomen county is the smallest, with a population of 5,411 residents. This is 12.57% (5,411 out of 43,044) of the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area, and 0.09% of the state population (5,411 out of 5,706,494).\n\n\n\nAge Distribution\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau (2022), the median ages for the counties are:\n\nPolk County: 39.3 years\nNorman County: 43.7 years\nMahnomen County: 35.1 years\n\nFor the state of Minnesota, the median age was 38.5 years, and the combined median age for Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area was 39.4 years, though this figure should be interpreted with caution as it wasn’t calculated from the raw data. Median age is used instead of the average age because it gives a clearer picture of the community’s age. The median age is the middle point, so it isn’t thrown off by very young or very old people. This way, we get a better idea of the typical age in the community. Mahnomen County has a younger population compared to Minnesota while Polk and Norman County have older populations compared to Minnesota with Polk county being the closest in age.\n\n\nSex Distribution\nThe Age Sex Population Pyramids below illustrate a generally balanced distribution of males and females across most age groups. You can determine the balance by examining the horizontal solid black midpoint line: a longer line indicates a greater difference between the male and female populations within that age group. The Age Sex Population Pyramids are based on the U.S. Census Bureau (2022) estimates. While there is a lot to examine, comparing Minnesota to the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area reveals that the midpoint line is similar, except for the age groups 25-29, 65-69, and 70-74.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity\nBased on the U.S. Census Bureau (2020b) data, the White population represents the highest percentage in both Minnesota and the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS area. Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS has a higher percentage of American Indian and Alaska Native residents, with Mahnomen County having the highest percentage among the three counties. It’s important to compare proportions rather than counts because proportions provide a relative measure that accounts for population size differences; Mahnomen County has more than double the percentage of residents identifying as Two or More Races compared to the state of Minnesota. The Black or African American and Asian population percentages are higher in Minnesota overall than the Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen CHS. Additionally, Polk and Norman counties have similar racial demographic profiles.\nWhen looking at ethnicity data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2020a), Polk County has a slightly higher Latino/Hispanic population compared to Minnesota overall, whereas Norman and Mahnomen counties have lower percentages of Latino/Hispanic residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Demographic Profiles Census Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease click on the corresponding map above for detailed demographic profiles of the specific counties.",

    "text": "Socioeconomic Status\nSocioeconomic status (SES) encompasses various factors such as income, education, and employment, which collectively influence an individual’s or community’s quality of life. Higher SES often correlates with better access to healthcare, education, and other essential services, leading to improved health outcomes. Conversely, lower SES can be associated with increased health risks and limited access to resources. Understanding SES is crucial for identifying disparities and implementing targeted interventions to promote equity and well-being within communities.\n\nCDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)\nThe CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) indicators are crucial because they help identify communities that might need extra help during emergencies like natural disasters or disease outbreaks. By understanding factors like poverty, lack of access to transportation, and crowded housing, we can better plan and provide support to those who are most at risk. The 2022 SVI developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/ Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (2022) uses estimates from the ACS 2018-2022. Before, we look at each counties SVI status, lets look at some of the indicators used to create the SVI scores. The SVI scale is 0 to 1 with 1 being the highest vulnerability.\nPolk County has several notable statistics regarding its population and housing. There are approximately 6,290 individuals below poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 2,870 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated 1,379 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Polk County has about 1,450uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 5,823 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 261 households have more people than rooms available.\nPolk County’s SVI scores are as follows:\n\nSocioeconomic Status: 0.593\nHousehold Characteristics: 0.6395\nRacial and Ethnic Minority Status: 0.7442\nHousing Type/Transportation: 0.9651\nOverall SVI: 0.8256\n\nPolk County:\n\nHigh Housing Cost Burden: A significant portion of households with incomes under $75,000 are spending more than 30% on housing, indicating financial strain.\nEducation and Insurance Gaps: A notable number of residents lack a high school diploma and health insurance, which can limit economic opportunities and access to healthcare.\nAging Population: With a large number of residents aged 65 and older, there may be increased demand for healthcare and senior services.\nHigh SVI Scores: The high scores in Housing Type/Transportation and Racial and Ethnic Minority Status suggest challenges in housing stability and potential disparities affecting minority groups.\n\nNorman County also presents several key statistics. There are approximately 1,145 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 518 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated 320 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Polk County also has about 394uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 1,373 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 45 households have more people than rooms available.\nNorman County’s SVI scores are as follows:\n\nSocioeconomic Status: 0.7326\nHousehold Characteristics: 0.5\nRacial and Ethnic Minority Status: 0.5465\nHousing Type/Transportation: 0.5698\nOverall SVI: 0.6395\n\nNorman County:\n\nModerate Vulnerabilities: The scores indicate moderate levels of socioeconomic and housing vulnerabilities.\nEducation and Insurance Needs: Similar to Polk County, there are gaps in education and health insurance coverage.\nAging Population: The presence of a significant elderly population highlights the need for age-related services and support.\n\nMahnomen County statistics are also noteworthy. There are approximately 1,897 individuals below the poverty line. Among occupied housing units with an annual income of less than $75,000, around 452 are considered cost-burdened, spending more than 30% on their income on housing costs. Additionally, an estimated423 residents aged 25 and older do not have a high school diploma. Polk County also has about 733uninsured individuals within the total civilian noninstitutionalized population. There are approximately 928 residents aged 65 and older. Lastly, around 90 households have more people than rooms available.\nMahnomen County’s SVI scores are as follows:\n\nSocioeconomic Status: 1\nHousehold Characteristics: 0.9535\nRacial and Ethnic Minority Status: 1\nHousing Type/Transportation: 0.8023\nOverall SVI: 0.9884\n\nMahnomen County:\n\nHigh Vulnerability: The highest SVI scores across all categories indicate severe vulnerabilities, particularly in socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic minority status.\nSignificant Education and Insurance Gaps: A high number of residents lack a high school diploma and health insurance, exacerbating economic and health challenges.\nAging Population: The elderly population, combined with other vulnerabilities, suggests a need for comprehensive support services.\n\nThe SVI project is a great start at figuring out what areas to invest in related to socioeconomic factors. However, it is not the only area we looked at.\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Education 3rd Grade Proficiency\nAccording to Minnesota Early Childhood Longitudinal Data System (2017-2023), Minnesota, Norman, and Polk experienced a decline in reading proficiency from 2022 to 2023 for third graders. Mahnomen County’s data was suppressed due to small counts, but the negative percentage change in the ‘not proficient’ reading status indicates improvement in this area. Although interpreting a double negative is not as straight forward as interpreting being proficient , it suggests that Mahnomen has made progress in reading proficiency from 2022 to 2023. In terms of math proficiency, Minnesota, Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen all showed positive improvement from 2022 to 2023. Norman County had the largest increase, followed by Mahnomen. Each county has unique needs, and even small positive improvements is encouraging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development Unemployment Rate\nOverall, the changes in unemployment rates between 2022 and 2023 are minimal, with most areas showing a slight increase of 0.1% or no change at all Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (2015-2023). This stability suggests a relatively steady job market in our counties. For instance, Minnesota’s unemployment rate increased marginally from 2.7% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023, while Mahnomen’s rate remained unchanged at 4.7%. Similarly, Norman and Polk counties experienced slight increases of 0.1%, indicating minor fluctuations in employment levels.\nIt’s important to note that there was a increase in unemployment rates in 2020, likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic led to widespread job losses and economic disruptions, which were reflected in higher unemployment rates across many regions. Since then, the job market has been gradually recovering, as evidenced by the relatively stable rates in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Profiles Department of Employment and Economic Development\nThe Department of Employment and Economic Development offers a comprehensive breakdown of additional data on population, education, labor force, income and cost of living, industry employment, and commuting patterns. These profiles provide valuable insights into the economic landscape of our three counties, aiding in effective planning. According to the profiles, all three counties—Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen—are projected to experience a decline in labor force from 2025 to 2035 Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: For detailed county profiles, please click on the corresponding map above.\n\n\n\n\n\nHunger Solutions: Food Shelf Household Visits\nIn 2022, food shelf visits in Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen counties reflected a need for food assistance.\nPolk County: Households made numerous visits to food shelves, highlighting the ongoing struggle with food insecurity in the area.\nNorman County: Similarly, there was a notable increase in food shelf visits, indicating that many families are facing economic challenges and require additional support.\nMahnomen County: The county experienced a high number of food shelf visits, underscoring the severe need for food assistance among its residents.\nThese trends align with the broader state data, which saw a record high of 5.5 million food shelf visits in Minnesota and was driven by rising food prices and increased demand from seniors, adults, and children Hunger Solutions (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDC Places\nThe CDC project provides estimates for 7 different measure topics: health outcomes, prevention practices, disabilities, social need factors, risk behaviors, health statuses, and social determinants of health. To limit information overload, selected topics were chosen based on local input. For these measures when looking to compare to the state as well as amongst the counties, please use the age-adjusted values. However, if you are just interested in looking at one county, the CHS, or the state at a time and not compare it them to other locations, please use either the crude or age-adjusted prevalence Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2024).\n\nFeeling socially isolated among adults was not significantly different between the counties, CHS, or Minnesota, based on the age-adjusted 95% confidence interval.\nHowever, Mahnomen County had significantly higher age-adjusted prevalence for food insecurity, food stamp usage, and housing insecurity in the past 12 months among adults compared to Polk County, Norman County, and the state of Minnesota.",

We may be unaware of the potential risks in our homes, workplaces, schools, or other areas in our communities, which could increase our chances of developing medical conditions. Lack of awareness can be detrimental to our health. The following environmental indicators are not meant to alarm but to educate us about the environmental factors we may encounter in our communities, helping us become more informed and proactive.\n\nMinnesota Department of Health Tickborne Disease Risk\nAs shown on the following map, Polk, Norman, and Mahnomen are identified as high-risk areas for tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease. During tick season, we should be proactive in preventative measures, such as using tick repellents and performing regular tick checks, to reduce the risk of infection. Our high-risk area underscores the importance of awareness to be proactive in our health practices. By staying informed and vigilant, we can better protect ourselves and our communities. Remember, early detection and prompt removal of ticks can lower the chances of disease transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: For more resources, please click anywhere on the map\n\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota Department of Health Private Wells Arsenic\nArsenic can be found in drinking water Minnesota Department of Health (2008-2021).

    "text": "Primary Care Providers and Dental Services:\nAccess to comprehensive health care services, including primary care and dental care, is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. Primary care providers play a critical role in early detection, prevention, and management of various health conditions. They offer a wide range of services, from routine check-ups and immunizations to managing chronic diseases and coordinating specialist care.\nSimilarly, dental services are vital for preventing and treating oral health issues, which can significantly impact overall health. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings help prevent cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. Dentists also provide essential education on maintaining good oral hygiene practices.\nImproving access to these services can lead to better health outcomes for our communities. Efforts to increase the availability of primary care providers and dentists, especially in underserved regions, are crucial. This includes initiatives to attract and retain healthcare professionals in rural areas, expanding telehealth services, and ensuring affordable care for all residents.\nPopulation per Primary Care Provider (2022) - Minnesota: 1,133 people per primary care provider.\n\nNorman County: Data not available (NA).\nPolk County: 1,809 people per primary care provider.\nMahnomen County: 5,414 people per primary care provider.\n\nThis indicates that, on average, Minnesota has 1,133 people per primary care provider, which suggests relatively good access to primary care across the state. Polk County has a higher ratio of 1,809 people per provider, indicating less access compared to the state average. Mahnomen County has the highest ratio with 5,414 people per provider, suggesting significantly less access to primary care services.\nPopulation per Dentist (2022) - Minnesota: 1,287 people per dentist\n\nMahnomen County: Data not available (NA)\nNorman County: 1,594 people per dentist\nPolk County: 2,195 people per dentist\n\nThis data suggests that, on average, Minnesota has 1,287 people per dentist, indicating relatively good access to dental care across the state. Norman County has a slightly higher ratio of 1,594 people per dentist, suggesting less access compared to the state average. Polk County has the highest ratio with 2,195 people per dentist, indicating significantly less access to dental care services.\nEven with potentially less access to primary care providers, the age-adjusted prevalence for having routine checkups is similar to the state average in Minnesota. About 3 out of 4 people are predicted to get their routine checkups. However, the consistency is not as strong for Medicaid beneficiaries receiving dental services. Assessing current performance is challenging due to lagging data and significant fluctuations in historical data.",
